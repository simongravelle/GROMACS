The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.250 nm between atom 662 and 663

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 293.15 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.411 nm, buffer size 0.011 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.400 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 40x48x96, spacing 0.100 0.094 0.092

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.14

This run will generate roughly 24 Mb of data
