The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.152 nm between atom 1746 and 1747

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 293.15 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.412 nm, buffer size 0.012 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.400 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 40x40x96, spacing 0.099 0.099 0.095

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.13

This run will generate roughly 22 Mb of data
